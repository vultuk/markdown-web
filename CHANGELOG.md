## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-21

Breaking changes
- Default authentication: Password auth is now enabled by default for the server and all `/api` endpoints. Existing unauthenticated workflows must pass a password. Use `--disable-auth` to opt out, or `--auth <password>` to set a custom password.
- API protection: `/api` is protected via session cookie; clients must include credentials.
- UI adjustments: Theme selector moved from header to Settings modal; preview default is ‚ÄúFull area‚Äù (can be changed).

Features
- CLI auth options: `--auth <password>`, `--disable-auth`, and generated random password by default.
- Auth endpoints: `/auth/status`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout` with signed HttpOnly session cookie.
- Settings modal: New UI with options for preview layout (Full area / Resizable split), sidebar behavior (Overlay / Inline), theme selection, OpenAI model, and scroll sync toggle.
- Persistent settings: Settings saved to `~/.markdown-web/settings.json`; client persists updates and shows a save toast.
- AI integration: Optional `--openai-key` enables an AI flow with prompt modal, per-request model override, Accept/Reject review, autosave pause during review, and theme-friendly UI polish.
- AI usage logging: Logs to `~/.markdown-web/logs/<encoded-filepath>/ai.json` with prompt, tokens, model, and estimated cost; Status bar shows per-file total cost.
- Syntax highlighting: Theme-aware code highlighting in preview and print/export (auto dark/light based on theme background).
- Mermaid support: Render ` ```mermaid` fenced blocks in preview with theme-aware Mermaid diagrams.
- Scroll sync: Optional editor/preview scroll synchronization in desktop split mode, toggleable in Settings.
- Desktop sidebar overlay: Sidebar can behave as an overlay on desktop (default) or inline resizable.
- Mobile UX: Uses `100dvh` for correct viewport sizing; keeps key UI elements visible.

Fixes & hardening
- Scrypt memory: Set explicit `maxmem` for Node‚Äôs scrypt to avoid memory errors on modern Node.
- Auth route ordering: Ensure auth + API routes are mounted before static/catch-all to avoid 401/HTML mismatches.
- Cookie handling: Client uses `credentials: 'same-origin'` for all API/auth endpoints.
- Large payloads: Increased JSON body limit (default 50MB) and configurable via `JSON_LIMIT`.
- Mermaid loader: Switched to a safer dynamic UMD loader path to avoid ESM init errors in production bundles.

Developer notes
- Server: Uses OpenAI official SDK (Responses API) and returns `output_text` for markdown-only responses.
- Dev proxy: Vite dev proxies `/auth` alongside `/api`.
